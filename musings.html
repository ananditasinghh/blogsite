<p class="moreserrat-font">1. The best thing about life was, that sometimes it felt too real.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">2. Time passed, which basically, is its job.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">3. Magic has a habit, of lying low. Like a rake in the grass.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">4. He is just a little dreamy. I suppose we all were young once.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">5. God had too many amazing ideas while putting the world together, but making it understandable was not one of them.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">6. We were flying, not touching the ground!</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">7. Belief is beautiful, and most of the time it’s true. And then when it’s not…I don’t count it as any time.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">8. So this was life? Huh? Well if not, let’s try it again.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">9. I want so much that’s not here, but I don’t know where it is.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">10. It’s not easy to fake a living, I mean just look at people, they are tired.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">11. Are your imaginary characters living out for real?</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">12. I’m a big fan of my words and occasionally, I love them.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">13. Have you ever lived so deeply in a moment that it just took your breath away?</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">14. Are you mad enough to live the right way, or are you rightly living the mad way?</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">15. The play was good, let the curtain fall.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">16. One fine day, my art departed.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">17. All of this is too well written in my mind.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">18. Why do our words match, when our thoughts don't</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">19. Funny, in the end, you might go mad as well.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">20. There is something captivating about being born in privilege and power, born to conquer.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">21. Art, time, people, and food these things should not be compared.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">22. There ain’t no evil, there ain’t no good, it’s just some stuff people do.</p>          
<p class="moreserrat-font">23. Let others mistake you for the sky. Go, Fly.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">24. You don’t even know whom you have borrowed your time from, so use it wisely.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">25. What is the worst place to live in? Fear. What is the best place to live in? Hope. </p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">26. Are you writing for someone to read or just putting random words together for someone to appreciate?</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">27. While the world was screaming so hard, it felt as if it was laughing.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">28. Keep saying no, and people will forget that you exist.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">29. It is a sin to make life boring, make it bad, make it good but never boring.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">30. The world never said that it was bad.</p>     
<p class="moreserrat-font">31. Copying this but why not, for you A thousand times over.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">32. Make ordinary beautiful, the extraordinary will take care of itself.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">33. You are here after a very long while, do whatever you want. Death can wait a little longer.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">34. For a moment, this moment felt so rare.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">35. Things in life are insignificant but do them anyways.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">36. Years, memories, books, and smiling faces, these things should not be counted. And maybe the political memorandums, aristocratic beliefs, and internet packages shouldn’t be counted as well.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">37. People don’t want to die before knowing the things they long to know and live knowing the things they hate to know. This is extremely sad.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">38. I won’t do the reality that unrests my imagination.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">39. If you’re mad enough to see, the sun’s always shining.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">40. Don’t expect to be green in autumn.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">41. Can’t be a hero for life? Well then go, be a hero for one day. Maybe it will change your life.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">42. Blurred past craving for a focused future and oscillating in between is freedom trapped in illusions.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">43. Infinity is sooo far, tell me about the art of living in this moment</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">44. Its beauty darling, it will come when it’s unexpected.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">45. So many of us die the same way, it’s just like the Same sunsets but different stories.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">46. There’s luck with life. But there’s no luck with death, it treats everyone equally.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">47. Whenever you feel lost, be a kid again.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">48. Who are you without your name?</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">49. And one unexpected day literature will save you.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">50. After you die, these words will get lost in time.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">51. Will you choose the choice by you over you?</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">52. Just one step beyond logic- go dare to dream now. Because it’s just one beyond. Logic.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">53. How about now for a while?</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">54. No amount of intellect can suppress the huge drama which humans do.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">55. So at least if we can imagine being happy, then why not?</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">56. All geniuses together make a good idiot.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">57. They are human, they have emotions and, intelligence can never overpower it.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">58. Even if you didn’t get it, but took the necessary risk to get it, you got it.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">59. People selling me better version of myself, oh what a scam.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">60. All of us are waiting, against the invincible odds, for something extraordinary to happen to us.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">61. They think you’re a fool.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">62. Don’t fear the ending. Truth is always revealed just seconds before the curtain falls.</p>             
<p class="moreserrat-font">63. And a lot of times, ‘today’ is the time.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">64. If you know it’s black, you know it’s not dark.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">65. So much to see, many to be.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">66. You are a mist that will vanish soon.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">67. Not all people are intelligent, some know what they write.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">68. Do you remember the times when you dreamt, where’s that now?</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">69. Complex speech in simple words is an art.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">70. You don’t need to be rich, famous, or powerful to help people. You just need to be a human.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">71. If it won’t be you it will be someone else.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">72. We are temporary thoughts living in the narrative of permanent illusions.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">73. An old wise soul once said, “I don’t do reality”.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">74. Some places have immense stories which just never happen.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">75. Come on it’s life, it’s not the way it is, like come on.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">76. The stage is empty, go play your part. The stage is crowded, go play your part.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">77. I don’t want to live, laugh, love, and dream for infinity. I want to do all of it at this moment.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">78. Don’t celebrate success too fast. Don’t admit failure too late.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">79. Trim out and shake off all the dead weight you’ve been wearing so far. It’s a new day, it’s a new hour, and looks like the sun is rising again.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">80. All that matters is how you narrate it, else the world has the same stories with different words.</p>   
<p class="moreserrat-font">81. Slow connectivity kills – the internet is the GOAT example</p>
<p class="moreserrat-font">82. Everything between the extremes of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ is merely fiddling through a dead life in search of no questions, no answers.</p> 
<p class="moreserrat-font">83. Living in the moments and oscillating between the memories and somewhere in the process, I find myself smiling through all the odds.</p>
